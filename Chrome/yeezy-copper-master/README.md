# Yeezy Copper

Chrome extension to automatically add Yeezys in your preferred size to your cart and then automate the checkout process.

## Motivation

Just trying to cop jawns with JavaScript.

## Usage

Add your information to the top of yeezyCopper.js inside the config object. Then just visit a sneaker product page on adidas.com and the script will take over. The 
script will also load at any step of the checkout process. You can also manually trigger the script by clicking the extension button.

## Captcha

If a captcha is presented, the script will pause until you complete the captcha and press "g" to resume the script. Looking into automating this.

## Installation

Download this repository and follow the instructions [here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) to set up a local extension.

## Notes:

* Assumes you're logged into the Adidas store already.
* Probably most fuccboi code on GitHub. I am not liable for anything you cop using this and I wouldnt use it unless you understand what its doing.
* Don't keep this running (Especially since it will auto cop on page load). Delete this garbage as soon as you cop.
* jQuery spaghetti chrome extensions are so fun to make. see also [twitter-classic](https://github.com/artnotfound/twitter-classic)
* T.L.O.P. the greatest album of life
